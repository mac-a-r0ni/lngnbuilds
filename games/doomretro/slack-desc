# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

doomretro: DOOM Retro is the classic, refined DOOM source port for any PC. It
doomretro: represents how I like my DOOM to be today, in all its dark and
doomretro: gritty, unapologetically pixelated glory. I have strived to craft a
doomretro: unique and cohesive set of compelling features, while continuing to
doomretro: uphold my respect for that classic, nostalgic DOOM experience many
doomretro: of us, after all this time, still hold dear.
