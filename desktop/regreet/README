ReGreet (Clean and customizable greeter for greetd)

A clean and customizable GTK-based greetd greeter written in Rust
using Relm4. This is meant to be run under a Wayland compositor
(like Sway). It is based on Max Moser's LightDM Elephant greeter,
which is based on Matt Shultz's Fischer's example LightDM greeter.
