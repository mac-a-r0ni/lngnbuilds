MullvadVPN-app Desktop Client

This is a repackaged Debian binary package for MullvadVPN's Desktop Client.

If by chance you're one of the elite few running the in-development
Slackware aarch64 port, you'll need to manually download this file
in the current working SlackBuild directory due to limitations with
SBo info files:

https://github.com/mullvad/mullvadvpn-app/releases/download/2023.4/MullvadVPN-2023.4_arm64.deb

The script will find it and build the appropriate package. DO NOT
download it unless you are on the ARM64 platform or else you will
end up with a broken package on x86_64.
