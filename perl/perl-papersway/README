perl-papersway (PaperWM-like scrollable tiling window mgmt for Sway)

This is an implementation of PaperWM-like scrollable tiling window
management for Sway/i3wm. If you like Sway/i3wm's commitments to
stability, avoiding scope creep etc. but dislike the window management
model, papersway is an alternative.
