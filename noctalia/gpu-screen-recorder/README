gpu-screen-recorder (A shadowplay-like screen recorder for Linux.)

This is a screen recorder that has minimal impact on system
performance by recording your monitor using the GPU only, similar to
shadowplay on windows. This is the fastest screen recording tool for
Linux. This screen recorder can be used for recording your desktop
offline, for live streaming and for nvidia shadowplay-like instant
replay, where only the last few minutes are saved. This software can
also take screenshots.
