colord is a system service that makes it easy to manage, install
and generate color profiles to accurately color manage input
and output devices.

This SlackBuild creates a 'colord' user/group if not existing upon
install.

This package can optionally add bash completion support by running:
BASH_COMPLETION=yes ./colord.SlackBuild

If you want argyllcms support (new dep: argyllcms), use:
ARGYLL=yes ./colord.SlackBuild
