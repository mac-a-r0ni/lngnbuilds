hyprcursor (hyprland cursor format, library and utilities)

XCursor sucks, and we still use it today.
 - Scaling of XCursors is horrible
 - XCursor does not support vector cursors
 - XCursor is ridiculously space-inefficient

Hyprcursor fixes all three. It's an efficient cursor theme format
that doesn't suck as much.
