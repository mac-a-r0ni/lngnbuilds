MullvadVPN-app Desktop Client

This is a repackaged Debian binary package for MullvadVPN's Desktop Client.

There is no 32bit application available, so the $DOWNLOAD is for the
ARM64-aarch64 client and the $DOWNLOAD_x86_64 is for the x86 one. The
script will build the right one for you.

You must also add this to /etc/rc.d/rc.local in order to 
start the daemon at boot:

if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.mullvad ]; then
  /etc/rc.d/rc.mullvad start
fi
