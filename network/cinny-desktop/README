Cinny Desktop - yet another Matrix client.

This is a native Slackware built application. The official scripts
build a deb package as well as an AppImage. One can also repackage
the official deb files, but they aren't guaranteed to work on
Slackware. By building a deb package locally, we guarantee
it's built with the correct libs and versions.

Cinny is also able to be used directly from the web with your
electron supporting browser of choice.

There is no 32bit application available.
