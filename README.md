# lngnbuilds
 SlackBuilds optimized for aarch64 machines.

Currently testing software aiming for slackwareaarch64-current but I provide some x86_64 packages as a courtesy to the community.

These SlackBuilds are a combination of software available on SBo and/or my own, fixed to build on arm64, generally packages are also available within these walls. Repos are split according to ones that overwrite official Slackware packages, and ones that do not.

The main "slackaroni" repository can be installed with no package conflicts, but the separate kde6,kde6-unstable, & lxqt repos will overwrite Slackware's officially shipped KDE5 package set. Use these repos with caution. External documentation can be found within the github repo for kde6.

For repository setup information, visit: https://slackware.lngn.net/

If you're looking for the KDE6 SlackBuilds, it's within a git-lfs repo hosted: https://github.com/mac-a-r0ni/kde6_slackware
