 SlackBuilds optimized for aarch64 machines.

Currently testing software aiming for slackwareaarch64-current
which will eventually become Slackware 15.1

If it's in this repo I have built and ran the software on at least
one machine successfully.

Machines used for testing: Pinebook Pro, MacMini M1 (asahi/slackware)

All packages tested and verified working.
